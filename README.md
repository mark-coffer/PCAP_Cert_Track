# PCAP_Cert_Track
Plan of action for achieving PCAP certification

This can be periodically updated with new informatin/resources that I find

1) Enroll in recommended Python courses from the official exam site to assist with study track ---Completed 5/5/22
2) Take practice quizzes and tests provided to evaluate competency (should be done periodically to evaluate weak areas/where to focus study)
  -- 
3) Purchase Exam and schedule exam day

I plan to spend --at minimum-- 3-4 hours daily in between assigned tasks completing prep work in an effort to expedite exam readiness
