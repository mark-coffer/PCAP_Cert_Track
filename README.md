# PCAP_Cert_Track
Plan of action for achieving PCAP certification

This can be periodically updated with new informatin/resources that I find

1) Enroll in recommended Python courses from the official exam site to assist with study track ---Completed 5/5/22
2) Take practice quizzes and tests provided to evaluate competency (should be done periodically to evaluate weak areas/where to focus study)
  -- 
3) Purchase Exam and schedule exam day   | - Current Goal is to test by: 7/15/22 - |

I plan to spend --at minimum-- 3-4 hours daily in between assigned tasks completing prep work in an effort to expedite exam readiness

Hurdles -- My goal was to spend the first 2 weeks studying intently and ideally take the test by 6/03/22, however,
           I am now preparing for future events which all interested parties are aware of or can request more 
           explaination as needed. I have lost 3 days of prep and expect to lose at least until 5/17/22 ensuring
           I meet the needs of the conflicting assignment as it takes priority.
           
        -- Due to an unfortunate payroll mishap, I will have to postpone purchasing the exam. I will update timeframes 
           once I know when I can correct this issue
           
        -- I am pushing out the expected date bc I am also learning new technologies related to anohter matter that will be known to those
           involved in this prep track. As well as focusing on some internal matters that are taking a lot of my focus currently due to higher priority.
